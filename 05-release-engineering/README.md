# Release Engineering Learning Outcome
-------
After attaining this skill, and as a demonstration of it, a fellow should be able to do the following:

- Setup a release plan for builds that have been tested through a CI system
- Version the builds as final builds and place them on a storage server
- Create release notes that identify the changes and fixes to the software that are present in the release
- Document release procedures on how to deploy/deliver the release



**Objectives**
--------------


## **Knowledge**

| Knowledge Unit   |      Studied      | Applied |
|:-----------------|:-----------------:|:-------:|
| I can describe the following from memory:| | |
| * How to implement code builds and automated deployment procedures | [ ] | [ ] |
| * How to document release procedures so it can be replicated | [ ] | [ ] |
| * How to setup a deployment process for deploying releases * | [ ] | [ ] |


----------------


## **Behaviors**

| Observable Behavior   |      Observed      | Mastered |
|:----------------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** When creating a release **Action:** I use only builds that have been thoroughly tested | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When creating a release **Action:** I ensure all code dependencies are met and present in the build | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** After a release is created **Action:** I add release notes to identify the changes/fixes that went are present in the release | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** After a release is created **Action:** I apply a release tag and add it to version control | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** After a release is created **Action:** I add the release to the storage system for tracking builds | [ ] | [ ] |

## **Beliefs**

| Embodied Belief   |      Felt          | Demonstrated |
|:------------------|:------------------:|:------------:|
| Software releases should be immutable | [ ] | [ ] |
| Changes to a software build results in a new build | [ ] | [ ] |
| Builds should be rigorously tested before being made into a release | [ ] | [ ] |
