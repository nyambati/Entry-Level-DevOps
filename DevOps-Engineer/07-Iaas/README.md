# Outcome 07 - Infrastructure As A Service

Skill Description
-----------------
The Fellow knows the services (virtualized computing resources) provided by AWS and how to utilize AWS to create and manage application environments


Outputs
-------
After attaining this skill, and as a demonstration of it, a fellow should be able to complete the following:

1. An exercise that covers the following operations:
  - Hosting a static website on Amazon AWS using Amazon S3
  - Creating a Server-Side encrypted S3 bucket on Amazon AWS and upload data to it
  - Creating a machine image on Amazon AWS
  - Creating a VPC with a private & public subnet on Amazon AWS using AWS Cloudformation
  - Launching a machine with the machine image created previously into the private subnet created above
  - Creating an autoscaling group

## **Behaviors**

| Observable Behavior   |      Observed      | Mastered |
|:----------------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** When I create a VPC **Action:** I create a security group with the least set of permissive rules to control access to the VPC| [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When an OS patch is released **Action:** I apply the patch to my running machines | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I create a user to access a IaaS resource **Action:** I ensure the user's permission is restricted | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I deploy my application to a IaaS **Action:** I deploy critical components of the application across multiple Availability Zones for redundancy | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** Before I launch/provision a machine **Action:** I create a VPC where my machine will be launched | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** Before I store data on a IaaS storage service **Action:** I encrypt the data | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** After I provision a machine on a IaaS **Action:** I put proper monitoring in place to gather metrics | [ ] | [ ] |

## **Beliefs**

| Embodied Belief   |      Felt      | Demonstrated |
|:------------------|:--------------:|:------------:|
| Services provisioned on a IaaS can be scaled as necessary to meet demands | [ ] | [ ] |
| IaaS provides elastic resources that can be provisioned on-demand to meet needs | [ ] | [ ] |
| The cloud provides the ideal environment for scalable applications | [ ] | [ ] |
